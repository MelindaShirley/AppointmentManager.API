# AppointmentManager.API
1) I have created a code first Enity Framework database in the local database. So the following commands need to be executed first in the package manager console for creation of DB.

Database instance:(localdb)\mssqllocaldb
Step1:
    Add-Migration "DBCreation"
Step2:
    Update-Database

2) The solution needs to be run and the swagger tool integration will help to test the APIs
